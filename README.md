## Design Process
  **Inspiration**
  The general theme that I included in my portfolio was simple and minimal web pages. I generally liked using colour to emphasise important parts on the website. For example, my homepage was inspired by Ryan Kulp's homepage. I wanted to have one key sentence that provided an introduction to my projects.

  **Wireframes**
  The initial designs for the portfolio were created for both desktop and mobile. I have included a PDF of the wireframes created at the begining of the project. 

  Below is an example of how the wireframes look like for mobile and desktop versions.
